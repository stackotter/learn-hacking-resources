# Contributing Guide

If you have any resources you think we should add feel free to make a pull request. But please only create a pull request once your changes/additions meet these guidelines.

## Folder structure

- [category name]
  - `README.md`
  - [resource name]
    - `README.md`
    - `reading` (if applicable)
      - general reading for the whole challenge...
      - [challenge name]
        - reading specific to challenge...
    - `challenges` (if applicable)
      - [challenge name]
        - `README.md`
    - `solutions` (contains writeups/solutions if applicable)
      - [challenge name]  
        - solution scripts and writeups...

All resources must have a `README.md` but all of the subfolders are optional. Resources with challenges/solutions should use the respective folders though (unless files are massive) because this avoids resources breaking when site owners move/remove pages.

If a resource is just a link to a website such as a Youtube video series or something similar you are not required to create a folder for it. It is ok to just supply links for the resource in the category's `README.md` section for that resource.
