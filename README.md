# Digital Overdose's Learning Resources

Welcome to the Digital Overdose CTF team's central repository for collating hacking resources from all around the place. We aim to curate and create resources for all skill levels and categories of hacking.

## Category Folders

The learning resources are split up into categories. The current categories are listed below;

- pwn
- web
- re
- crypto

In each of these folders you will find a `README.md` which contains an overview of each resource for that category.

## Resource Folders

Inside each category folder there is a folder for each resource (with the name listed in the category's `README.md`). Each resource folder contains a `README.md` describing the resource and any additional files.
